- Implements a thread-safe connection pool for managing DNS connections
- Features:
  - Dynamic connection creation based on nameserver list
  - Connection validity checking
  - Thread-safe connection acquisition and release
  - Timeout handling for queries

#### 2.1.2 DNS Query Handler (DNSQuery.cpp)
- Handles construction and parsing of DNS queries
- Key functionalities:
  - Query construction with proper DNS header format
  - Support for multiple record types (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.)
  - Domain name encoding/decoding
  - Response parsing with comprehensive error handling

#### 2.1.3 Cache System (DNSCache.cpp)
- Implements an LRU cache with TTL support
- Features:
  - Thread-safe operations
  - TTL-based entry expiration
  - LRU eviction policy
  - Automatic expired record cleanup

#### 2.1.4 DNS Resolver (DNSResolver.cpp)
- Main resolver implementation with:
  - Parallel query support
  - Recursive resolution
  - CNAME chain following
  - Statistics tracking
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 2.2 Notable Features

#### 2.2.1 Parallel Resolution
```cpp
std::vector<DNSRecord> DNSResolver::resolveParallel(
    const std::string &domain,
    DNSRecordType type)
{
    std::vector<std::future<std::vector<DNSRecord>>> futures;
    for (const auto &ns : config.nameservers) {
        futures.push_back(std::async(std::launch::async,
            [this, &domain, type, &ns]() {
                return queryNameserver(ns, domain, type);
            }));
    }
    // ... result collection
}
```

#### 2.2.2 Caching Implementation
```cpp
bool DNSCache::get(const std::string &key, std::vector<DNSRecord> &records)
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(cacheMutex);
    auto it = cache.find(key);
    if (it == cache.end()) return false;
    
    auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
    std::vector<DNSRecord> validRecords;
    // ... TTL checking and record validation
}
```

## 3. Testing Results

### 3.1 Resolution Test Results
Based on the test output for google.com:

#### Record Types Retrieved:
1. A Records: 12 records
   - Multiple IPv4 addresses (142.250.x.x, 74.125.x.x)
   - TTLs ranging from 48 to 300 seconds

2. AAAA Records: 7 records
   - IPv6 addresses (2404:6800:4009:...)
   - TTLs consistently at 300 seconds

3. MX Records: 7 records
   - Consistent preference value of 10
   - Single mail exchanger (smtpgoogle.com)

4. TXT Records: 14 records
   - Various verification records
   - SPF records
   - Consistent TTL of 3600 seconds

### 3.2 Performance Metrics
From the statistics output:
- Total queries: 5
- Cache hits: 1
- Cache misses: 4
- Failed queries: 0
- Cache hit ratio: 20%

## 4. Implementation Highlights

### 4.1 Resilience Features
